title: As a developer, I wanted to set up a Custom Domain.
---

Hello,

So today I wanted to set up a custom domain for my portfolio site.  I was using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to host my current site but wanted a more personal address for my portfolio.  There are quite a few options out there to purchase a domain name from, I chose <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> to purchase mine from as I had experience with them in the past.  The process is fairly simple really, it may vary from company to company,  but you just type in the name you would like to use for your domain.  In my case I chose a character name I have used throughout my computing and video gaming career,  <a href="https://www.Quellick.com/">Quellick</a>.  It was available (meaning nobody else had purchased that specific name), so I purchased it for a year.  You can choose to purchase for a longer period of time but I find having to renew your domains once a year is a good time to audit them and make sure they are something you still need/want.

Once you have the domain name itself the rest is fairly simple for me as <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> has a very simple process to set up redirects.  I just needed to go to my GitHub account,  select the repo I was using for my portfolio page, and then go into the settings for that repo.  Once in the options page you just need to scroll down until you see the GitHub Pages section.  Within that section you should see a Custom Domain option,  just fill that in with the domain you purchased.

At this point everything should be working right?  That's what I thought to.. but turns out I had to do some configuration with <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> first.  Your DNS provider, in my case its the same as my domain name provider (most domain name registers offer some sort of free DNS providing as well). Using <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap's</a> dashboard it was easy to find the settings for my domain.  They show all the host records associated with a specific domain.  In this case I needed to adjust the settings for my CNAME Record..  Namecheap had the site set up to visit their landing page rather than my portfolio.  So I updated the file with the correct Value.. in this case my github pages site address Quellick.github.io.  And now.. everything works.   If I type in quellick.com it now redirects me to www.quellick.com and it displays my portfolio page being hosted on GitHub pages but with my snazzy new personal domain name.
