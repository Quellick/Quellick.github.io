title: As a developer, I want to fork and clone a Jekyll portfolio theme
---

Hello,

So today I needed to set up a new blogging site as my portfolio website.  I am going to use Jekyll for the site template as well as Cloud9.  
Since I am using Cloud9 I used these resource as my instructions.  

https://www.jflh.ca/2016-01-18-running-jekyll-on-cloud9.
https://community.c9.io/t/setting-up-jekyll/1707

First off, I chose from the two available theme choices and forked the repo into my GitHub.
